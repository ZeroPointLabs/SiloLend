## Notes
- Unused supply should be held in deposits
  - Withdraws are in Beans, not deposits. This removes ability/incentive to harvest high stalk deposits
  - Not an optimized Silo position. Enough to match a new Deposit.

- Suppliers can receive an ERC20 representing their position

- Should interest be higher or lower than fresh Silo Deposit?
  - If yes, short term supplying to BeanShare is always more profitable than Depositing.
  - If no, borrowers can leverage silo via looping.
  - If sometimes yes, sometimes no...?

## Feature Requests
In the spirit of shipping value quickly, not every feature and capital optiization will be in v1. Here we list known optimizations that did not make the cut.

- Enable Planting of collateral deposits to enable compound gains for borrowers

- Hold supply as a Deposit to capture Silo APR
